 *      For monthly processing, credit interest to the account balance
 *      
 * Checking accounts have these special rules:
 *      When the account is created, a per-transaction fee is set. Every check written will be charged this amount.
 *      Checking accounts will allow overdraws. However, a $5 fee will be added to the monthly fees for each overdraw.
 *      For monthly processing, debit total overdraft fees as well as a transaction fee for every check written.
